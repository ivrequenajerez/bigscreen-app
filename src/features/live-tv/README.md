# Feature: Live TV

Contains all the logic, components, and services specific to the main Live TV screen.  
Includes the elements from the Figma design: video player, overlay with title and logo, Play/Pause button, and the channel carousel.  
Each subfolder inside `ui/`, `model/`, and `services/` corresponds to a separate layer (view, state, data).
